      <p>My name is Ansu Tommy, and I am a student currently studying Web Development. I have a deep interest in technology and enjoy learning how websites and applications are built to connect people and share information globally. Through my studies, I am gaining skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other modern tools that will help me design, develop, and maintain responsive and user-friendly websites.

         I come from Sierra Leone, a beautiful country in West Africa with a rich cultural history and strong traditions of resilience. Known as the "Lion Mountain," Sierra Leone is a land of diverse ethnic groups, languages, and natural beautyâ€”from its beaches and mountains to its vibrant communities. Growing up in Sierra Leone has shaped my perspective and inspired me to use technology as a way to contribute positively to society, create opportunities, and showcase the talents of my country to the wider world.</p>
